# Codebase Concerns

**Analysis Date:** 2025-02-20

## Tech Debt

**Index status never set to "ready":**
- Issue: POST /project sets index_status to "indexing" and creates a K8s ingest Job, but no callback or watcher updates it to "ready" (or "failed") when the Job completes.
- Files: `crew_api/app.py`, `crew_api/ingest_job.py`
- Impact: GET /project may show "indexing" indefinitely; UI cannot reliably know when RAG is ready.
- Fix approach: Add a Job watcher/poll or use K8s Job completion webhook/callback to update app.state.index_status; or document that clients must poll/track Job status separately.

**Configuration scattered across os.environ.get:**
- Issue: No central settings module; env vars read ad hoc in app.py, runner_client.py, ingest/run.py, runner/app.py, search_tool.py, with varying defaults and names (e.g. RUNNER_URL vs RUNNER_SERVICE_URL, VECTOR_DB_URL vs CHROMA_URL).
- Files: `crew_api/app.py`, `crew_api/runner_client.py`, `ingest/run.py`, `runner/app.py`, `crew_api/crew/tools/search_tool.py`
- Impact: Harder to document and validate required env; risk of inconsistency between components.
- Fix approach: Introduce pydantic-settings (or single config module) and load once at startup; inject config into routes/clients.

**Crew API in-memory state:**
- Issue: project_path, pinned_repo, index_status live only in app.state; lost on restart and not shared across replicas.
- Files: `crew_api/app.py`
- Impact: Multi-replica or restarts lose project context; no persistence for "current project".
- Fix approach: Document as single-replica or move to external store (e.g. Redis, DB) if scaling or durability is required.

## Known Bugs

- No explicit bugs documented in code (no TODO/FIXME/HACK found in code-helper Python files). Index status never transitioning to "ready" is a behavioral gap rather than a single bug.

## Security Considerations

**Runner path allowlist (ALLOWED_ROOT):**
- Risk: If ALLOWED_ROOT is misconfigured or overly broad, Runner could run commands in sensitive paths.
- Files: `runner/app.py` (_validate_project_path), tests set ALLOWED_ROOT=/tmp.
- Current mitigation: realpath comparison; project_path must be under ALLOWED_ROOT; 400 on violation.
- Recommendations: Document ALLOWED_ROOT clearly for deployers; consider read-only or dedicated workspace mount in K8s.

**Runner command allowlist:**
- Risk: Allowlist is prefix-based (pytest, npm, cargo, go, python, node); subprocess receives full command list, so "python -c '...'" can run arbitrary code under allowed root.
- Files: `runner/app.py` (ALLOWED_COMMAND_PREFIXES, _validate_command)
- Current mitigation: Only executable name (first element) is checked; no shell expansion (subprocess.run with list).
- Recommendations: Treat as "safe only when ALLOWED_ROOT is constrained"; document that Runner executes arbitrary code within that root. Optional: tighter allowlist (e.g. only pytest with specific args) if policy requires.

**No authentication on APIs:**
- Risk: crew_api and runner are unauthenticated; anyone with network access can call /chat, /run, /execute, and trigger ingest Jobs.
- Files: `crew_api/app.py`, `runner/app.py`
- Current mitigation: None.
- Recommendations: Add auth (API key, JWT, or network policy) for production; document that default setup is for dev/trusted networks.

**Ingest Job receives project_path from API:**
- Risk: Malicious or mistaken project_path could point to sensitive path inside the Job if the pod has access; K8s Job args are controlled by crew_api (which trusts its caller).
- Files: `crew_api/ingest_job.py`, `k8s/ingest-job.yaml`
- Current mitigation: Job runs in cluster with image args; workspace mount is optional and may be restricted by PVC.
- Recommendations: Ensure ingest Job has minimal volume mounts; validate or sanitize project_path if it is derived from user input.

## Performance Bottlenecks

**Crew kickoff is synchronous:**
- Problem: handle_chat calls crew.kickoff(inputs) synchronously; long-running crew can block the worker.
- Files: `crew_api/chat.py`, `crew_api/app.py`
- Cause: CrewAI kickoff is blocking; no async/background task in FastAPI.
- Improvement path: Run kickoff in a thread pool or background task (e.g. asyncio.to_thread, FastAPI BackgroundTasks) so /chat returns after queuing, or return streaming/async response if CrewAI supports it.

**No caching for RAG or search:**
- Problem: Every tool call hits Chroma or external search; repeated queries are not cached.
- Files: `crew_api/crew/tools/rag_tool.py`, `crew_api/crew/tools/search_tool.py`
- Cause: Stateless tool design.
- Improvement path: Optional in-memory or Redis cache keyed by (collection_id, query) and (query) for search if latency/cost is an issue.

## Fragile Areas

**K8s Job creation from crew_api:**
- Files: `crew_api/ingest_job.py`
- Why fragile: Depends on in-cluster config or kubeconfig; BatchV1Api() with no explicit config uses default (in-cluster or env). Tests mock the API so no real cluster needed, but integration depends on cluster being present and namespace/config correct.
- Safe modification: Keep create() signature; extend with optional k8s client injection for tests; document namespace and image env vars.

**Runner tool sync wrapper:**
- Files: `crew_api/crew/tools/runner_tool.py`
- Why fragile: _default_execute_sync uses asyncio.run() inside a sync _run; if called from an already-running event loop (e.g. in some CrewAI execution paths), can cause issues.
- Safe modification: Prefer async tool API if CrewAI supports it; or ensure RunnerTool is only invoked from sync context. Tests inject execute_sync to avoid asyncio.run.

**Chat UI CORS and API base:**
- Files: `chat_ui/app.js`, `chat_ui/README.md`
- Why fragile: Serving from different origin than crew_api requires CORS on crew_api; API base is query param or global; no error handling for network/CORS in UI.
- Safe modification: Add CORS middleware to crew_api if needed; document CORS for deployers; optional fallback message in UI on fetch failure.

## Scaling Limits

**Single-replica / in-memory state:**
- Current: One crew_api instance assumed for app.state; one runner, one Chroma in default manifests.
- Limit: Multiple crew_api replicas will not share project_path/index_status; Runner and Chroma can become bottlenecks.
- Scaling path: Externalize state (Redis/DB), scale Runner and Chroma (e.g. Chroma scaling docs), consider queue for ingest Jobs.

**Chroma single instance:**
- Current: One Chroma service in docker-compose and k8s.
- Limit: Memory and throughput bound by single instance.
- Scaling path: Use Chroma’s scaling/persistence options or switch to another vector store with scaling story.

## Dependencies at Risk

- No specific deprecated or known-vulnerable packages flagged in the analysis. crewai and chromadb are fast-moving; pin versions and periodically review release notes and security advisories.

## Missing Critical Features

**Index status lifecycle:**
- Problem: No way to mark index "ready" or "failed" after ingest Job completes.
- Blocks: Reliable "is RAG ready?" in UI or automation.

**Auth and multi-tenancy:**
- Problem: No auth; no notion of tenant or user for project/chat.
- Blocks: Shared or production deployment without external auth/proxy.

**Chat UI robustness:**
- Problem: Minimal UI; no history, no streaming, no clear CORS/error handling.
- Blocks: Production-quality chat experience without additional front-end work.

## Test Coverage Gaps

**CLI:**
- What's not tested: cli/main.py (_run_tests, _chat_one, _chat_interactive) not covered by tests in tests/.
- Files: `cli/main.py`
- Risk: Regressions in CLI args or HTTP handling.
- Priority: Medium (CLI is thin wrapper).

**Runner tool with real runner:**
- What's not tested: No integration test that crew_api and runner run together (only mocked transport).
- Files: `crew_api/crew/tools/runner_tool.py`, `crew_api/runner_client.py`
- Risk: Environment or serialization mismatches in production.
- Priority: Low if E2E is run manually or in CI with compose.

**Ingest end-to-end:**
- What's not tested: No test that runs full ingest (real Ollama + Chroma or real Chroma) in CI; tests use embed_func and EphemeralClient.
- Files: `ingest/run.py`
- Risk: Integration bugs with real embed API or Chroma HTTP.
- Priority: Low to Medium (optional E2E job or smoke test).

**Chat UI:**
- What's not tested: No automated tests for chat_ui (JS/HTML).
- Files: `chat_ui/`
- Risk: UI regressions or API contract drift.
- Priority: Low (minimal UI).
